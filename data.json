        "content": "The first world war, or great war as it’s often known, started in 1914. There were many complex, multifaceted causes of the war, but it’s generally agreed by most historians that the war started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated. This was the trigger that caused the war to begin, and several European powers who had not been on great terms anyway, were brought into conflict.\n\nThe first world war was the first large scale war to be fought using modern, mechanised warfare and as such as was one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, with 16 million soldiers and civilians having perished before its end in 1918. Modern mechanisms of death, such as tanks, machine-guns, and aircraft, faced off against more traditional forms of warfare, including infantry advances and mounted combat. While the war has gained a reputation for pointless, unmitigated slaughter, it also was saw a great deal of heroism.\n\nSome historians claim that ways the war itself never really ended, as the causes of the second world war can be traced directly to the first."
